        <strong>🎯 What are Closures?</strong><br />
        Closures allow functions to "remember" variables from their outer scope
        even after the outer function has finished executing. Each pizza chef
        below has their own private memory of customer preferences - that's
        closure in action!

        <h3>🧠 The Closure Magic Behind The Scenes:</h3>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          const createPizzaChef = (name, personality) => { // These variables
          are "closed over" - private to each chef! let customerPreferences =
          []; let pizzasMade = 0; let mood = "😊 Happy"; return { rememberOrder:
          (toppings) => { customerPreferences.push({toppings, date: new
          Date()}); return `${name} says: "Got it! I'll remember that!"`; },
          makePizza: (toppings) => { pizzasMade++; return `🍕 ${name} made a
          delicious pizza with ${toppings.join(', ')}!`; }, // Each chef
          remembers their own data - that's closure! }; };
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Point:</strong> Each chef has their own independent
          memory. Chef Mario can't see Chef Luigi's orders, and vice versa!
